/**
 * PointInShapeEvaluator can be used to tell if a particular {@link Point} is contained by a {@link Polygon} or
 * {@link Circle}. It is most useful to eliminate false positive when a geo query has been made using a {@link Box
 * bounding box} approximation. For the purpose of this class, a point on the edge of a polygon isn't considered within
 * it. On the contrary a point on the edge of a circle is considered in it (distance from center <= radius). To that
 * end, {@link #removeFalsePositives(Collection, Converter, Circle) additional methods} that return a {@link List} of
 * objects with false positives removed are also provided. However, these need a {@link Converter Converter&lt;T,
 * Point&gt;} to extract the location attribute that should be tested against the polygon/circle.
