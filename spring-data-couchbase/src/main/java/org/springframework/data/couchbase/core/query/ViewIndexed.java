 * This annotation is targeted at {@link CouchbaseRepository Repository} interfaces, indicating that the framework

 * The view must at least be described as a design document name and view name. Default map function will filter
 * documents on the type associated to the repository, and default reduce function is "_count".
 * <p>
 * One can specify a custom reduce function as well as a non-default map function.
