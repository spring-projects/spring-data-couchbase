/**
 * The {@link Cluster} is the main entry point when connecting to a Couchbase cluster.
 * <p>
 * Most likely you want to start out by using the {@link #connect(String, String, String)} entry point. For more
 * advanced options you want to use the {@link #connect(String, ClusterOptions)} method. The entry point that allows
 * overriding the seed nodes ({@link #connect(Set, ClusterOptions)} is only needed if you run a couchbase cluster
 * at non-standard ports.
 * <p>
 * See the individual connect methods for more information, but here is a snippet to get you off the ground quickly. It
 * assumes you have Couchbase running locally and the "travel-sample" sample bucket loaded:
 * <pre>
 * //Connect and open a bucket
 * Cluster cluster = Cluster.connect("127.0.0.1","Administrator","password");
 * Bucket bucket = cluster.bucket("travel-sample");
 * Collection collection = bucket.defaultCollection();
 *
 * // Perform a N1QL query
 * QueryResult queryResult = cluster.query("select * from `travel-sample` limit 5");
 * System.out.println(queryResult.rowsAsObject());
 *
 * // Perform a KV request and load a document
 * GetResult getResult = collection.get("airline_10");
 * System.out.println(getResult);
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * When the application shuts down (or the SDK is not needed anymore), you are required to call {@link #disconnect()}.
 * If you omit this step, the application will terminate (all spawned threads are daemon threads) but any operations
 * or work in-flight will not be able to complete and lead to undesired side-effects. Note that disconnect will also
 * shutdown all associated {@link Bucket buckets}.
 * <p>
 * Cluster-level operations like {@link #query(String)} will not work unless at leas one bucket is opened against a
 * pre 6.5 cluster. If you are using 6.5 or later, you can run cluster-level queries without opening a bucket. All
 * of these operations are lazy, so the SDK will bootstrap in the background and service queries as quickly as possible.
 * This also means that the first operations might be a bit slower until all sockets are opened in the background and
 * the configuration is loaded. If you want to wait explicitly, you can utilize the {@link #waitUntilReady(Duration)}
 * method before performing your first query.
 * <p>
 * The SDK will only work against Couchbase Server 5.0 and later, because RBAC (role-based access control) is a first
 * class concept since 3.0 and therefore required.

   * Connect to a Couchbase cluster with a username and a password as credentials.
   * <p>
   * This is the simplest (and recommended) method to connect to the cluster if you do not need to provide any
   * custom options.
   * <p>
   * The first argument (the connection string in its simplest form) is used to supply the hostnames of the cluster. In
   * development it is OK to only pass in one hostname (or IP address), but in production we recommend passing in at
   * least 3 nodes of the cluster (comma separated). The reason is that if one or more of the nodes are not reachable
   * the client will still be able to bootstrap (and your application will become more resilient as a result).
   * <p>
   * Here is how you specify one node to use for bootstrapping:
   * <pre>
   * Cluster cluster = Cluster.connect("127.0.0.1", "user", "password"); // ok during development
   * </pre>
   * This is what we recommend in production:
   * <pre>
   * Cluster cluster = Cluster.connect("host1,host2,host3", "user", "password"); // recommended in production
   * </pre>
   * It is important to understand that the SDK will only use the bootstrap ("seed nodes") host list to establish an
   * initial contact with the cluster. Once the configuration is loaded this list is discarded and the client will
   * connect to all nodes based on this configuration.
   * <p>
   * This method will return immediately and the SDK will try to establish all the necessary resources and connections
   * in the background. This means that depending on how fast it can be bootstrapped, the first couple cluster-level
   * operations like {@link #query(String)} will take a bit longer. If you want to wait explicitly until those resources
   * are available, you can use the {@link #waitUntilReady(Duration)} method before running any of them:
   * <pre>
   * Cluster cluster = Cluster.connect("host1,host2,host3", "user", "password");
   * cluster.waitUntilReady(Duration.ofSeconds(5));
   * QueryResult result = cluster.query("select * from bucket limit 1");
   * </pre>
   *
   * @param connectionString connection string used to locate the Couchbase cluster.
   * @param username the name of the user with appropriate permissions on the cluster.
   * @param password the password of the user with appropriate permissions on the cluster.

   *   <li>Or a custom {@link Authenticator}</li>

   *

   * the code sample above) and <strong>AFTER</strong> the cluster is disconnected. This will ensure an orderly shutdown
   * and makes sure that no resources are left lingering.
   * <p>
   * If you want to pass in a custom {@link Authenticator}, it is likely because you are setting up certificate-based
   * authentication instead of using a username and a password directly. Remember to also enable TLS.
   * <pre>
   * ClusterEnvironment environment = ClusterEnvironment
   *   .builder()
   *   .securityConfig(SecurityConfig.enableTls(true))
   *   .build();
   *
   * Authenticator authenticator = CertificateAuthenticator.fromKey(...);
