import com.couchbase.client.java.transactions.error.TransactionCommitAmbiguousException;

/**
 * The transaction expired at the point of trying to commit it.  It is ambiguous whether the transaction has committed
 * or not.  Actors may be able to see the content of this transaction.
 *
 * This error is the result of inevitable and unavoidable edge cases when working with unreliable networks.  For example,
 * consider an ordinary mutation being made over the network to any database.  The mutation could succeed on the
 * database-side, and then just before the result is returned to the client, the network connection drops.  The client
 * cannot receive the success result and will timeout - it is ambiguous to it whether the mutation succeeded or not.
 *
 * The transactions logic will work to resolve the ambiguity up until the transaction expires, but if unable to resolve
 * it in that time, it is forced to raise this error.  The transaction may or may not have been successful, and
 * error-handling of this is highly application-dependent.
 *
 * An asynchronous cleanup process will try to complete the transaction: roll it back if it didn't commit, roll it
 * forwards if it did.
