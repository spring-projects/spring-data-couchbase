[[couchbase.configuration]]
= Installation & Configuration

This chapter describes the common installation and configuration steps needed when working with the library.

[[installation]]
== Installation

All versions intended for production use are distributed across Maven Central and the Spring release repository.
As a result, the library can be included like any other maven dependency:

.Including the dependency through maven
====
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-data-couchbase</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
----
====

This will pull in several dependencies, including the underlying Couchbase Java SDK, common Spring dependencies and also Jackson as the JSON mapping infrastructure.

You can also grab snapshots from the https://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot[spring snapshot repository] and milestone releases from the https://repo.spring.io/libs-milestone[milestone repository].
Here is an example on how to use the current SNAPSHOT dependency:

.Using a snapshot version
====
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-data-couchbase</artifactId>
  <version>2.1.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>

<repository>
  <id>spring-libs-snapshot</id>
  <name>Spring Snapshot Repository</name>
  <url>https://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot</url>
</repository>

Once you have all needed dependencies on the classpath, you can start configuring it.
Both Java and XML config are supported.
The next sections describe both approaches in detail.

[[configuration-java]]
== Annotation-based Configuration ("JavaConfig")

The annotation based configuration approach is getting more and more popular.
It allows you to get rid of XML configuration and treat configuration as part of your code directly.
To get started, all you need to do is subclcass the `AbstractCouchbaseConfiguration` and implement the abstract methods.

Please make sure to have cglib support in the classpath so that the annotation based configuration works.

.Extending the `AbstractCouchbaseConfiguration`
====
[source,java]
----

@Configuration
public class Config extends AbstractCouchbaseConfiguration {

    @Override
    protected List<String> getBootstrapHosts() {
        return Collections.singletonList("127.0.0.1");
    }

    @Override
    protected String getBucketName() {
        return "beer-sample";
    }

    @Override
    protected String getPassword() {
        return "";
    }
}
----
====

All you need to provide is a list of Couchbase nodes to bootstrap into (without any ports, just the IP address or hostname).
Please note that while one host is sufficient in development, it is recommended to add 3 to 5 bootstrap nodes here.
Couchbase will pick up all nodes from the cluster automatically, but it could be the case that the only node you've provided is experiencing issues while you are starting the application.

The `bucketName` and `password` should be the same as configured in Couchbase Server itself.
In the example given, we are connecting to the `beer-sample` bucket which is one of the sample buckets shipped with Couchbase Server and has no password set by default.

Depending on how your environment is set up, the configuration will be automatically picked up by the context or you need to instantiate your own one.
How to manage configurations is not in scope of this manual, please refer to the spring documentation for more information on that topic.

Additionally, the SDK environment can be tuned by overriding the `getEnvironment()` method to return a properly tuned `CouchbaseEnvironment`.

While not immediately obvious, much more things can be customized and overridden as custom beans from this configuration (for example repositories, query consistency, validation and custom converters).

TIP: If you use `SyncGateway` and `CouchbaseMobile`, you may run into problem with fields prefixed by `_`.
Since Spring Data Couchbase by default stores the type information as a `_class` attribute this can be problematic.
Override `typeKey()` (for example to return `MappingCouchbaseConverter.TYPEKEY_SYNCGATEWAY_COMPATIBLE`) to change the name of said attribute.

TIP: For generated queries, if you want strong consistency (at the expense of performance), you can override `getDefaultConsistency()` and return `Consistency.READ_YOUR_OWN_WRITES`.

[[configuration-xml]]
== XML-based Configuration

The library provides a custom namespace that you can use in your XML configuration:

.Basic XML configuration
====
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans:beans xmlns:beans="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/data/couchbase
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
    https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/data/couchbase
    https://www.springframework.org/schema/data/couchbase/spring-couchbase.xsd">

    <couchbase:cluster>
      <couchbase:node>127.0.0.1</couchbase:node>
    </couchbase:cluster>

    <!-- This is needed to probe the server for N1QL support -->
    <!-- Can be either cluster credentials or a bucket credentials -->
    <couchbase:clusterInfo login="beer-sample" password=""/>

    <couchbase:bucket bucketName="beer-sample" bucketPassword=""/>
</beans:beans>
----
====

This code is equivalent to the java configuration approach shown above.
You can customize the SDK `CouchbaseEnvironment` via the `<couchbase:env/>` tag, that supports most tuning parameters as attributes.
It is also possible to configure templates and repositories, which is shown in the appropriate sections.

IMPORTANT: The XML configuration **must** include the `clusterInfo` credentials, in order to be able to detect N1QL feature.

If you start your application, you should see Couchbase INFO level logging in the logs, indicating that the underlying Couchbase Java SDK is connecting to the database.
If any errors are reported, make sure that the given credentials and host information are correct.
