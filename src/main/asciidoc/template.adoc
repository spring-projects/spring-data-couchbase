[[couchbase.template]]
= Template & direct operations

The template provides lower level access to the underlying database and also serves as the foundation for repositories.
Any time a repository is too high-level for you needs chances are good that the templates will serve you well.

[[template.ops]]
== Supported operations

The template can be accessed through the `couchbaseTemplate` bean out of your context.
Once you've got a reference to it, you can run all kinds of operations against it.
Other than through a repository, in a template you need to always specify the target entity type which you want to get converted.

To mutate documents, you'll find `save`, `insert` and `update` methods exposed.
Saving will insert or update the document, insert will fail if it has been created already and update only works against documents that have already been created.

Since Couchbase Server has different levels of persistence (by default you'll get a positive response if it has been acknowledged in the managed cache), you can provide higher durability options through the overloaded `PersistTo` and/or `ReplicateTo` options.
The behaviour is part of the Couchbase Java SDK, please refer to the official documentation for more details.

Removing documents through the `remove` methods works exactly the same.

If you want to load documents, you can do that through the `findById` method, which is the fastest and if possible your tool of choice.
The find methods for views are `findByView` which converts it into the target entity, but also `queryView` which exposes lower level semantics.
Similarly, find methods using N1QL are provided in `findByN1QL` and `queryN1QL`.
Additionally, since N1QL allows you to select specific fields in documents (or even across documents using joins), `findByN1QLProjection` will allow you to skip full `Document` conversion and map these fields to an ad-hoc class.

WARNING: If it is detected at runtime that the cluster doesn't support N1QL, these methods will throw a `UnsupportedCouchbaseFeatureException`.

If you really need low-level semantics, the `couchbaseBucket` is also always in scope through `getCouchbaseBucket()`.

[[couchbase.template.xml]]
== Xml Configuration

The template can be configured via xml, including setting a custom `TranslationService`.

NOTE: In the example above most tags assume their default values, that is a localhost cluster and bucket "default".
In production you would have to also provide specifics to these tags.
