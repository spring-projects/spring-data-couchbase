[[couchbase.migrating]]
= Migrating from Spring Data Couchbase 1.x to 2.x

This chapter is a quick reference of what major changes have been introduced in 2.0.x and gives a high-level overview of things to consider when migrating.

[[couchbase.migrating.configuration]]
== Configuration

The configuration, xml schema, etc... has changed to take the evolution of the 2.x SDK API into account.

Where a single `CouchbaseClient` bean was previously the only bean declarable, you can now declare a `Cluster` bean (`<couchbase:cluster>`), one or more `Bucket` beans (`<couchbase:bucket>`) and even tune the SDK via a `CouchbaseEnvironment` bean (`<couchbase:env>`).
All of these can also be created via Java Config method by extending `AbstractCouchbaseConfig`.

The cluster bean lists the nodes to connect through (and references the environment bean if tuning is necessary) while the bucket beans map to bucket names and passwords and actually opens the connections internally.

You can define more beans that are used for internal configuration of the Spring Data Couchbase module (`MappingContext`, `CouchbaseConverter`, `TranslationService`, ...).

For more information, see <<couchbase.configuration>>.

[[couchbase.migrating.repository-queries]]
== Repository queries

The view-backed query method has evolved and support for N1QL has been introduced.
As a result, there are now 4 ways of doing repository queries:

* Simple View query (to return all elements emitted by a view) - @View annotated without `viewName`
* Intermediate View query by query derivation (to provide some criteria for the view) @View annotated with `viewName`
* N1QL with explicit statements inline - `@Query` annotated with value
* N1QL query derivation - `@Query` annotated without value / no annotation (default)

View backed queries are associated with the `@View` annotation, while N1QL backed queries are associated with the `@Query` annotation.

N1QL query derivation is now the default query method (and there the `@Query` annotation is optional).

See <<couchbase.repository.n1ql>> and <<couchbase.repository.views>> for more information.

[[couchbase.migrating.backing-views]]
== Backing views and view query changes

IMPORTANT: The `all` view is still backing most CRUD operations, but custom repository methods are now by default backed by N1QL.

To instead back them with views, use the `@View` annotation explicitly.

Without a `viewName` specified, the view will be guessed from method name (stripping `count` or `find` prefix).
Otherwise, query derivation will be used to parameterize the view query from the method name and parameters.

[[couchbase.migrating.view-query]]
=== Passing a ViewQuery object as a parameter to a custom repository method

This behavior has been removed and the recommended approach is now to either use query derivation (if the query parameters are simple enough) or <<repositories.single-repository-behaviour>>.

For instance, for a view emitting user lastNames, the following:

[source,java]
----
@View
List<User> findByLastname(ViewQuery.from("","").key("test").limit(3));
----

is to be replaced by the (more flexible):

[source,java]
----
@View("byLastName")
List<User> findFirst3ByLastnameEquals(String lastName);
----

[[couchbase.migrating.reduce-in-views]]
=== Reduce in views

Reduce is now supported in view-based querying.

It can be triggered by prefixing the method name with `count` instead of `find`.
For example: `countByLastnameContains(String word)` instead of `findByLastnameContains(String word)`.

Alternatively, it can be explicitly be activated by setting `reduce = true` on the `@View` annotation.

Be sure to construct your view correctly:

* specify a reduce function that matches the method return type, which can be anything, eg. long or JSON object
* emit a simple key (not `null` nor a compound key).
* emit a value suitable for the reduce to work (typically `_count` doesn't need any particular value, but `_stats` will need a numerical value, in addition to the key).
